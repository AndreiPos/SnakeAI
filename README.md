# SnakeAI
Teaching an AI how to play Snake using **Reinforcement learning** and **Deep Q Learning**.

This project has been done as a University coursework and I was required to have 4 different files.


For the program to work properly the files must be run in the following order:
1. Snake.py
2. Model.py
3. Helper.py
4. Agent.py
